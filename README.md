# A beginning of a bot for Discord

## How to bring our baby Moulinette to life ðŸ¤–

* Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the dependencies
* Run `source discord_env/bin/activate` at the root of the repo.
* `python3 bot.py` 

That should wake Moulinette up. Be careful as there is a *personal token* inside the main.py file (yes, I know this is bad practice). It is also needed to manually add the bot to any server you wish.
