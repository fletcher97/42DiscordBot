Ladies, Gentleman, and @everyone,

You may not know it yet, but this is the moment you've all been waiting for :smiling_imp: Some say the hardest characters are the ones which remain, well...

...after 26 days dealing with my hard and unmovable opinion about your code, the nightmares, the headaches, the frustration I brought you... even after all that, you still love me, don't deny it. This school_logo_white community wouldn't be complete without me, your beloved, yet dreaded, <@!moulinette>. But you can call me Mouli :robot:

**What will I do :muscle:**
I will help the <@&staff> with the community moderation (check the <#rules> and <#welcome> channels!) role assigning, houses and organizing events.

**How do I work :gear:**
I run with Python and I am modular, meaning it's possible to arm me with new features. Would you like me to play some music? And then grade and debug all your code? World domination? :earth_africa:

**What can you do :punch:**
I do hope you are all excited as my creators are, as I need your help to expand my capabilities - while also improving your Python skills in the meantime. :snake: The <@&staff> has documentation and workflows for you to work on me. So if you are interested, let them know about it!

Btw, I have a couple of cool tricks up my sleeve and hidden Easter eggs! Will you find them all? :eyes:
